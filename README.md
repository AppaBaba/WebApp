# WebApp
 Creating Simple Web Applications

Years ago, I learn HTML, JavaScript and ASP.NET to deploy them on IIS (Windows Web server).
My setup used a minimum of seven PCs for multiple projects and beta testing before you deploy
to production server. Ok, you can do this with two PCs. Just need one server and one client.

More recent, well about five years ago, I start looking at IOT hub servers. After looking for
a while, I started with the Intel IOT-devkit. The experience of evaluating the IOT-devkit lead
to very good understanding of IOT-HUBs. The things that were learned are edge device interface,
node, node-red and web services.  The node.js alone got me exited. Up until this point, I had
no idea how easily a web service could be to setup. I mean make your own server. Something that
I tried before, but in Linux with C++. When I found out that you could do the same in python it
was just to much for me. Well of course I jump all over it, just like when doing it in node. By
the way I did setup IOT-HUB server using MQTT-Broker, node, node-red and edge-device.

What is going to be done here is show how a simple server can be setup using python or node.
Then maybe show how to do some ASP.NET stuff also.
